This is the relevant section of the eBay listing offering [Ric 27](/post/ric27) and [Ric 28](/post/ric28). Thanks to Mark Strong of [Meibohm Fine Arts](http://meibohmfinearts.com/) for finding Ric and granting permission to use his text.

He created some sections on [meibohmfinearts.com](http://meibohmfinearts.com/) if you just want to get more infomation on a specific topic:

* [Ric and Fritz Neumann](https://www.meibohmfinearts.com/artists/details/155)

* [Kunstverlag J.C. Blumenberg](https://www.meibohmfinearts.com/artists/details/2874)

His different findings deserve some additional pages or posts on this blog as well, for now I'll let him speak:
