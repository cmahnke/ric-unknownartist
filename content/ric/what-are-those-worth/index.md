Due to popular demand (this question is responsible for 90% of inquiries), I'll try to answer the question:

# What are prints of Ric worth?

This question is hard to answer accuratetly. Since these prints aren't numbered, it is not immediately obvious that they are actually not that rare. At least not in the north of Germany.

Based on my own experience:
* A typical price on a flea market is between 10€ and 25€
* In a junk or thrift shop you can get those for 20€ to 40€

Keep in mind that these prices apply on framed sheets, so a unframed sheet is worth from 10€ to 30€

If you encounter an offer on eBay or a similar platform, which is above 70 € framed, it's certainly to expensive.

In the end depends on how much you're willing to pay...
