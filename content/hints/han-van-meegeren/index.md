Recently I've found another [hint](/post/a-clue-from-the-old-blog) pointing to [Han van Meegeren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_van_Meegeren). This guy has a very interesting biography.

In the comment the work "deer with fawn" is mentioned. You can find some versions of it using the Google Image Search, but the quality is to low to verify the claims of the commenter.
