**Short description:** This is my third print of the Sailing boats ([Ric 07](/tags/ric-07)). This print is interesting because it is not framed behind glass, but has been mounted on cardboard. The sheet has also been cropped to such an extent that not even the signature has been preserved.

**Notes:** Found on a flea market in Hannover.
