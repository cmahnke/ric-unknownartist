After getting the message, that Fritz Neumann (1928â€“2014) is not our Fritz Neumann, it was about time to check possible candidates again. One interesting new hint was [this offer](https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/s-anzeige/8-gemaelde-aquarelle-fritz-neumann-1928-2014-berlin/2807167569-240-1236) on Kleinanzeigen (formerly "eBay Kleinanzeigen"). The ad is dated 08.07.2024 and offers 8 paintings (watercolours) by a Fritz Neumann, the signature is very similar to that of the prints by "our" Fritz Neumann...
Unfortunately, the seller did not get back to me to allow me to take over the pictures and especially his text: In addition to doubts as to whether Fritz Neumann (1928-2014) can be the creator of the pictures, the text also offers some interesting clues as to how he came to these doubts.
He did some research on old address books, I'll keep trying to get into touch...
