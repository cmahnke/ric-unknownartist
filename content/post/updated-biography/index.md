After it turned out that Fritz Neumann (1928-2014) [is not Ric](https://ric-unknownartist.projektemacher.org/post/mystery-again/), Mark Strong has updated the biographies at [Meibohm Fine Arts](https://www.meibohmfinearts.com/artists/details/2873) and [AskArt.com](https://www.askart.com/artist/Fritz_Neumann/11057559/Fritz_Neumann.aspx).

Many thanks to Mark for this!

Hopefully the false attributions on eBay and other auction sites will now be less...
