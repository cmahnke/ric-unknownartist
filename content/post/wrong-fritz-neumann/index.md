Every regular reader will spot the error in the screen shot above really quick:
* This page is about Fritz Neumann (1881 – 1918)
* The second image shows a sailing boat, which is probably by another Fritz Neumann, especially since this one died 1918 and the construction of the [„Laboe Naval Memorial“](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboe_Naval_Memorial), which can be seen in the background, was started in 1927. The building is also on my [Brick expressionism blog](https://backsteinexpressionismus.projektemacher.org/tags/Marine-Ehrenmal-Laboe/)...
