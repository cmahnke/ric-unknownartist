**Short description** : Two dogs, fox terrier.

**Notes** : Taken from [eBay](https://www.ebay.de/itm/HERMANN-FRITZ-NEUMANN-kol-Radierung-1910-20-ZWEI-FOXTERRIER-/372190490460). This one is quite interesting, it’s attributed to Hermann Fritz Neumann and should be quite old. It also features the stamp mark, but in another form: The letters “J”,&nbsp;“C” and&nbsp;“B” are not overlapping, and are put in the middle of the [Holstentor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holstentor).
