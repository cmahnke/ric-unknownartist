Since both the [address book entries](/en/post/fritz-neumann-address-book-berlin/) and some of Fritz Neumann's works (such as [this](/en/post/fritz-neumann-painting-genossenschaftsfamilie/) from August 1935 or [this](/en/post/rosenthal-fritz-neumann/) from between 1934 and 1951) date from the time of the ‘3rd Reich’, it is relatively likely that he was a member of the [Reichskunstkammer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichskammer_der_bildenden_K%C3%BCnste). Membership was compulsory at the time...

And indeed, in the Landesarchiv Berlin, which administers the files of the Reichskammer der bildenden Künste, Landesleitung Berlin, there is a personal file on Fritz Neumann, born on 18 June 1905, under the archive signature [A Rep. 243-04 No. 6261](http://www.landesarchiv-berlin.findbuch.net/#41205265702e203234332d3034x8709)!

In addition, you can find a [Finding aid of the collection](http://www.content.landesarchiv-berlin.de/php-bestand/arep243-04-pdf/arep243-04.pdf
) can be found. This also contains evidence of several auctions in which a ‘Fritz Neumann’ is mentioned...

There is also at least one Fritz Neumann in the files of the Reichschrifttumskammer, kept at the Bundesarchiv.
