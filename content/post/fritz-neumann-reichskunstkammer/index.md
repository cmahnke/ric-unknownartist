Since both the [address book entries](/en/post/fritz-neumann-address-book-berlin/) and some of Fritz Neumann's works (such as [this](/en/post/fritz-neumann-painting-genossenschaftsfamilie/) from August 1935 or [this](/en/post/rosenthal-fritz-neumann/) from between 1934 and 1951) date from the time of the ‘3rd Reich’, it is relatively likely that he was a member of the [Reichskunstkammer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichskammer_der_bildenden_K%C3%BCnste). Membership was compulsory at the time...

And indeed, in the Landesarchiv Berlin (state archive Berlin), which administers the files of the "Reichskammer der bildenden Künste", Landesleitung Berlin, there is a personal file on Fritz Neumann, born on 18 June 1905, under the archive signature [A Rep. 243-04 No. 6261](http://www.landesarchiv-berlin.findbuch.net/#41205265702e203234332d3034x8709)!

In addition, you can see that there is a [Finding aid of the collection](http://www.content.landesarchiv-berlin.de/php-bestand/arep243-04-pdf/arep243-04.pdf
). This also contains evidence of several auctions in which a ‘Fritz Neumann’ is mentioned...

And there is also at least one [Fritz Neumann](https://invenio.bundesarchiv.de/invenio/direktlink/3f763ab4-cbe1-4844-b0ff-1428688ca01d/) in the files of the "Reichschrifttumskammer", kept at the Bundesarchiv, but we'll ignore it for now...

The finding aid also reveals a date of birth: 18 June 1905!

And with this date there is even more: Fritz Neumann, born on 18 June 1905, was probably a teacher at the Staatsbauschule Berlin-Neukölln. At least there is a [corresponding personnel file](https://invenio.bundesarchiv.de/invenio/direktlink/481b2e22-4fd5-4d88-8442-d50dcab9aa85/) in the branch of the Federal Archives in Berlin-Lichterfelde. The school merged into today's Berlin University of Applied Sciences via [several intermediate steps](https://www.bht-berlin.de/fileadmin/oe/alumni/bild/Historie/Geschichtliche_UEbersicht.pdf).

But is this 'our' Fritz?
