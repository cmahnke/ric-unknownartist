---

# Das Haus der Frau

One of the experts helping me out from time to time is Gerbrand Caspers, also known as [The Linosaurus](https://gerrie-thefriendlyghost.blogspot.com/), has started a new project.
I've been following his work for about a decade and his colloction of woodcut prints is quite impressive.
Please have a look at his new project website [Das Haus der Frau](https://www.dashausderfrau.nl/), he also offeres a printed lexicon containing the results of his research.
