**Short description:** Four prints of Terrier puppies by Fritz Neumann.

**Notes:** Found on [Everything But The House](https://www.ebth.com/items/6839331-fritz-neumann-drypoint-engravings-of-terrier-puppies). This is a good indication why the prints of Fritz Neumann aren't marked: They certainly had a relative high count of print runs, possibly only limited by the metal of the plate.
