**Short description:** This is a painting of the motive found on [Ric 20](/tags/Ric-20/). The title is probably "Treppengasse", which is in [Altenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altenburg), Germany.

Since it's a painting and not another copy of the etching, it get's it's own number (Ric 32).

**Notes:** Found by Andra Robertson at an estate sale, send to me by mail.
