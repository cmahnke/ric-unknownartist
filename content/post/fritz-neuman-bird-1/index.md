**Short description:** A colourised print of a bird by Fritz Neumann. The bird is either a [Baltimore oriole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_oriole) or another [New World oriole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_oriole) species. Since there are no records that Neumann has ever been in America (yet), he might have seen it at an Aviary.

**Notes:** Found on eBay
