The original note where our Fritz Neumann confirms that he is Ric, published by Mark Strong of Meibohm Fine Arts included an address:

{{< figure src="Fritz_Neumann_RIC_Signed_Letter_For_Pseudonym_Sept_24_1963_Sm.jpg" width="400px" link="https://www.meibohmfinearts.com/artists/details/155" >}}

His address is **Gartenfelder Str. 132 h** in **Berlin Haselhorst**.

Since Torsten Steinberg, the author of the ad mentioned in the [last post](/post/fritz-neumann-watercolour-paintings/) wrote about the [old address books of Berlin](https://digital.zlb.de/viewer/berliner-adressbuecher/) I tried to do the same. This are the results, the first result was from 1937:

{{< figure src="1937.png" width="400px" link="https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:kobv:109-1-2207597/fragment/page=1948" caption="Address book 1937" class="center" >}}

{{< figure src="1957.png" width="400px" link="https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:kobv:109-1-15357662/fragment/page=1499" caption="Address book 1957" class="center" >}}

{{< figure src="1961.png" width="400px" link="https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:kobv:109-1-15356869/fragment/page=1139" caption="Address book 1961" class="center" >}}

{{< figure src="1970.png" width="400px" link="https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:kobv:109-1-15356982/fragment/page=1035" caption="Address book 1970" class="center" >}}

Above only random samples, therefore the cut-outs are not continuous. No address books are available after 1970, so here are some extracts from telephone directories.

{{< figure src="1978.png" width="400px" link="https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:kobv:109-1-6587414/fragment/page=1915" caption="Phone book 1978" class="center" >}}

{{< figure src="1984.png" width="400px" link="https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:kobv:109-1-6810838/fragment/page=1589" caption="Phone book 1984" class="center" >}}

This at least makes it clear that our Fritz Neumann lived and worked in Berlin for around 50 years. And perhaps died in 1984, or at least stopped working as a graphic designer, e.g. because he went into an old people's home.
