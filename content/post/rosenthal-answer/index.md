title: An answer from Rosenthal
---

A while a ago I've added [a post showing a painted tile](/post/rosenthal-fritz-neumann) painted by Fritz Neumann and produced by [Rosenthal](https://www.rosenthal.de/en/info/company/the-rosenthal-company/company-history/). Since the company has quite a history they also offer a archive research service.
In spring 2019 I've send them an inquiry about the history of this particular product and the artist, Today I got an answer. Since I don't have their permission I don't quote the reply here. The raw facts:
* Produced by Rosenthal Handmalerei in Munich between 1934 and 1951, since the mark was only used in this time span - especially for export goods to the USA.
* *A painting by the German painter Fritz Neumann (1881-1919) was used as a template.*

Every regular reader will be surprised now and notice that the dates of life and the theme do not go together: The second statement is wrong with a probability bordering on certainty, but so far there has been no answer.
