title: 'Wikipedia article on "Kunstverlag J.C. Blumenberg"'
---

There is now a Wikipedia Article on the ["Kunstverlag J.C. Blumenberg"](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunstverlag_J.C._Blumenberg), the publisher where many prints of Fritz Neumann and his wife published their works, in the German Wikipedia. It also includes images of the blind stamp to enable easier recognition (e.g. via Google Lens).

Thanks to all contributors for their help!
