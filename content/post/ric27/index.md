**Short description** Another street scene with a lantern and a wind mill (which isn't red - as one can suspect if this should be Paris).

**Notes** : Taken from [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/FRITZ-NEUMANN-AKA-RIC-SIGNED-Vintage-c-1960s-Color-Etching-STREETSCENE-/143672853431).

**The description on eBay is very interesting, there is a [post](/post/mystery-solved) about it.**
