Since the identity of Fritz Neumann has been clarified and the [extracts from the civil registers](https://ric-unknownartist.projektemacher.org/post/fritz-neumann-civil-register/) are known, we know about his wife Hedwig Klinge. Since the beginning of the year, some examples of [her work](https://ric-unknownartist.projektemacher.org/tags/hedwig-klinge/) can be found in this blog.

Now Peter Schmelzle has come forward. Since 2018, he has been searching for the person behind the signature ‘Klinge’. He also asked his readers to send in examples of corresponding graphics and thus created a small collection of examples of graphics by Hedwig Klinge. He recently became aware of the [contribution with the etching of a magnolia](https://ric-unknownartist.projektemacher.org/post/hedwig-klinge-magnolias/) and was thus able to clarify the identity.

Further works by Hedwig Klinge and the complete story of her ‘rediscovery’ can be found on the pages of the [Kunstsammlung Schmelzle](https://kunstsammlung.peterschmelzle.de/klinge).
