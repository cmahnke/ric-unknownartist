A few day ago I bought an interesting book at my [favorite rare book book seller](): A catalog of deliverable prints of the ["Kunstverlag Hanfstaengl](https://www.copperprint.de/blogs/news/uber-den-kunstverlag-franz-hanfstaengl-heute-blanc-kunstverlag)" for the year 1961. The woman at the counter told me that the book has been sitting around on the shelf for ages and offered me to look up the price again, just in case the value dropped. Thy have tho policy to offer books at a lower price then the one on the web. It turned out, that the price increased in the last years, but in that case they stick with the original offer.

Prints made by "Kunstverlag Hanfstaengl" are quite common in Germany, you can find them often on flea markets, the quality is good, and many people are confused by the fact, that they can be very old.

Anyways, I bought the book, since i've discovered a print in it, that I own
