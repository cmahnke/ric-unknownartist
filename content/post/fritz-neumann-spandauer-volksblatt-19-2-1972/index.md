title: "Article on Fritz Neumann in Spandauer Volksblatt 19.2.1972"
sticky: true
---
Today I received an e-mail from Sebastian Schuth, head of the archive of the Spandau City History Museum. Attached to it was a newspaper article from the Spandauer Volksblatt of 19 February 1972 (Archive signature IV C Z ZA PA 1038), the title:

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
  Segelboote für Millionäre und Vögel für sich selbst<br/>
  (Sailboats for millionaires and birds for themselves)
</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
  Fritz Neumann: "Ich male am liebsten, was ich sehe ..."<br/>
  (Fritz Neumann: "My favourite thing to paint is what I see ...")
</p>

The article is about the person who has been sought after here for years, the Spandau artist Fritz Neumann. The article has now revealed a few more details:
* Fritz Neumann was born in December 1897
* Studied at an art school from 1912 to 1916, where he also met his future wife Hedwig Neumann (born as Klinge)
* Was in Verdun during the First World War
* Managed an advertising studio afterwards
* Started his own business as a painter and etcher in 1930. (This can be roughly traced in the [address books](/post/fritz-neumann-address-book-berlin/))
* Took part in World War 2 "from the very beginning"

We also learn that his wife published her works under her maiden name, Hede Klinge, even after their marriage. As well as the fact that he worked for the ["Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Allgemeine_Zeitung) - certainly after the First World War.

In addition to the stages of his life, the various motifs and places from which Neumann drew his inspiration are also discussed.

## Origin and family

With this data, for example, an [entry on Geneanet.org](https://gw.geneanet.org/mhayda?n=neumann&oc=&p=franz+robert+fritz) can be found, which allows the data to be narrowed down further:

* Full name: **Franz Robert Fritz Neumann**
* Date of birth: **6 December 1897**
* Date of death: **8 June 1984**
* Wife: **Anna Hedwig Klinge**
  * Date of birth: 21 September 1895
  * Date of death: 5 November 1980
  * Wedding day 2 May 1925
* Parents:
  * Ludwig Karl Franz Neumann 1858-1933
  * Clara Emilie Emma Wusterhausen 1871-1942
* Brother: Wilhelm Franz Rudolf Neumann 1901-

## Connections to other articles

By the way, the name "Hede Klinge" already appears by pure luck in an older article about [copyright entries](/post/fritz-neumann-copyright-records/), now it becomes obvious that it was not so coincidental.

And it is also clear that the Fritz Neumann from the [Archiv der Reichskunstkammer](https://ric-unknownartist.projektemacher.org/post/fritz-neumann-reichskunstkammer/) is not "our" Fritz Neumann.

## Update 24.10.2024

In the meantime, I have also received another reference from Torsten Steinberg: He sent me an extract from the death register. According to this, Fritz Neumann died on 8 June 1984 in the Havelhöhe Community Hospital in Berlin Spandau.
