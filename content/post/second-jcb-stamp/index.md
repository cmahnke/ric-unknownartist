This is the probably older version of the blind stamp that's used on some prints by Fritz Neumann.

It imitates the Holsten Gate in Lübeck (second image), another indication of a North German origin. So far, inquiries from the Lübeck City Archives about former art publishers in the city have not yet been answered.

For examples of the blind stamp in use, see:
