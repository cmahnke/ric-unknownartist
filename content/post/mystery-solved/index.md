While doing the migration away from Tumblr and adding old drafts I also checked some links. The one pointing to the Google Image search showed two new Ric prints (see Ric 27](/post/ric27) and [Ric 28](/post/ric28)). And as if that weren't enough luck, I could hardly believe my eyes when I read the description: Someone not only claimed to have solved the Ric mystery, he also provided proof. Since I'm still in my migration project, I didn't manage to update all affections sections and pages yet. But the relevant part of the eBay description has it's own [page](/ric/mystery-solved) now. Great work Mark!
