**Short description:** Another street scene with a lantern and a wind mill.

The same [seller](http://meibohmfinearts.com/) also offerers a [colourised version](/post/ric27).

**Notes:** Taken from [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/FRITZ-NEUMANN-AKA-RIC-SIGNED-Vtg-c-1960s-B-W-Etching-STREETSCENE-/133483534361?hash=item1f143d1819)

**The description on eBay is very interesting, there is a [post](/post/mystery-solved) about it.**
